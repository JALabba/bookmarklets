# bookmarklets
A couple of bookmarklets for convenience.

---
## Remove twitter likes

Open your twitter profile likes page, and use the bookmarklet. Every second it hits unlike, and then scrolls. It stops after 30s by default.


## Search highlighted text on wikipedia

Highlight some text, then hit the bookmarklet to open a new tab with a search of wikipedia.
